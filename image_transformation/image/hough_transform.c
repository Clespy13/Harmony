/* The Hough transform based image will convert (x,y) coordinate
 * Into polar coordinate (ρ,θ):
 * ρ : distance between the origin of the plot and the line
 * θ : the angle created by ρ
 * On a ρ = x*cos(θ)+y*sin(θ)
 * I will also be Using the function ceil to round the result of the conversion of basis
 * What I will be Doing is :
 *        For every X :
 *                For every Y :
 *                    Get the Color of the pixel (Get color function)
 *                    for θ from 0 to 180 :
 *                         ρ = ceil(x*cos(θ)+y*sin(θ))
 *
 *
 * The dimension of the accumulator equals the number of unknown parameters, in our case two
 * considering quantized values of r and θ in the pair (ρ, θ).
 * Since we are going to have a Two dimension array for the accumulator for the dimensions.
 * We want the accumulator first dimension to be the same size has the diagonal of the matrix
 *
 * To get this size we can just apply the pythagorean theorem :
 *                       so if we have 'd' has the diagonal
 *           d = √(image widht * image widht + image height * image_height)
 * Note that rho and theta cannot be Null or equal 0
 * We are going to build a parameter space with (ρ,0)
 * 
 *  Initializing all the values that are in my accumulator
 *
 * We know that 0 is between PI and Zero and it will be necessary to find the value of 0
 * What I will do here is Initialize two new Arrays one that will contain the of sin(0) and the other Array will contain the value of  cos(0)
 * I am doing this to facilitate the computation of ρ in terms of readabilite of the code
